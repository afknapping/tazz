# Protostack

A prototyping stack for designers.

## Goal

The goal is to have a complete frontend first stack to quickly prototype, deploy and test apps. Ideally it can be started with three commands (clone, install dependencies, start server).

## Tools so far

[Hub](http://hub.github.com/), [Node](http://nodejs.org/), [Bower](http://bower.io/), [Angular](http://angularjs.org/), [Colors](http://clrs.cc/).

## Missing or still-to-be-evaluated

[Hoodie](http://hood.ie/), [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/), [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/), [RequireJS](http://www.requirejs.org/), [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), [Compass](http://compass-style.org/).

## Nogos

Bootstrap. px units

## Open questions

Hoodie as base? Where and how to deploy? How is the database handled (deployD)? What testing framework? 

## Please help

At the time, you are already helping by suggesting stuff. Just submit an issue.

Thx.

## Roadmap

This is a personal project for 2014. Lots of research and tryout to be done, before this will become usable (if at all).
