# Protostack

A prototyping stack for designers.

## Goal

The goal is to have a complete frontend first stack to quickly prototype, deploy and test apps. Ideally it can be started with three commands (clone, install dependencies, start server). (Respectively install Yo, run generator, start server.)

## Tools so far

[Hub](http://hub.github.com/), [Node](http://nodejs.org/), [Bower](http://bower.io/), [Angular](http://angularjs.org/), [Colors](http://clrs.cc/).

## Missing or still-to-be-evaluated

Yeoman - Yo, Grunt(-CLI), Bower.

[Hoodie](http://hood.ie/), [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/), [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/), [RequireJS](http://www.requirejs.org/), [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), [Compass](http://compass-style.org/).

### Testing

[PhantomCSS](https://github.com/Huddle/PhantomCSS) for [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/) for [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/).


## Nogos

Bootstrap. px units

## Open questions

Hoodie as base? Where and how to deploy? How is the database handled (deployD)? What testing framework? 

## Please help

At the time, you are already helping by suggesting stuff. Just submit an issue.

Thx.

## Roadmap

This is a personal project for 2014. Lots of research and tryout to be done, before this will become usable (if at all).
